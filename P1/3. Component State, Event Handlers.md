1. It is very common practice to define functions within JS components
	1. This means that these functions are nesting inside of their parent function, the component 
	2. Typically helper functions, for manipulating data for use in the component 
2. Destructuring 
	1. Can be used on arrays and on objects
	2. Array
		1. `const t = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` -> `const [first, second, ...rest] = t`
	3. Object
		1. `const obj = { name: 'Kevin', age: 27 }` -> `const { name, age } = obj`
3. Stateful components
	1. React provides state hooks, like `useState()`
	2. Initialized like `const [state, setState] = useState(0)`
	3. The function call to `useState` sets the variable `state` to zero
		1. Further updates can be made to the integer by calling `setState`
4. Event Handling
	1. Functions which are registered to be called when a certain event occurs within an application
	2. Can be click, mouse, blur, and many more
5. Passing state to child components
	1. Lifting state
		1. Taking stateful variables and functions and moving them up to a parent component, to be passed directly to children 
		2. If multiple components need a particular state, it should be lifted to the nearest ancestor
6. Changes in state cause rerendering
