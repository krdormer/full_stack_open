1. Official name for JavaScript is ECMAScript
	1. Current version is ECMAScript2022 or ES13
2. Browsers do not support many of the new features in JS, so it must be transpiled into an older more compatible version
	1. Transpiled: To convert code from one form into another, with the meanings remaining the same 
	2. `const getValue = () => value` will be transpiled into `function getValue () { return value }`
		1. Most popular transpiler for React is `Babel` 
3. Node.js
	1. JavaScript runtime environment based on Chrome's V8 engine
	2. Latest versions of Node understand current version of JS so no need for transpiling 
	3. Running a JS program in node:
		1. `node fileName.js`
		2. Can also type `node` into the browser console, or in a command line 
4. Variables
	1. Can define a JS variable in a number of ways:
	2. `const`
		1. Defines a constant, the value of which cannot be changed 
		2. Can be used in a global context 
	3. `let`
		1. Defines a normal variable, which can be changed
		2. Limited to block context 
	4. `var`
		1. Also defined a normal variable that can be changed
		2. However, is no longer common practice due to the odd scoping patterns it follows 
5. Arrays
	1. `[ ...values ]`
	2. Can be defined as a const while being able to change 
		1. This is because the reference to the array remains the same, but the values contained in it can be updated 
	3. `concat()`
		1. Method built into JS arrays to replace functionality of `arr.push()` 
		2. Returns a new array object with the item added to it, as opposed to pushing an item into the previously referenced array
	4. Iterating
		1. `arr.map()` - Returns a new array of items, if conditions applied will return a new array with elements matching the given condition 
		2. `arr.forEach()` - Iterates over each item in an array
	5. Destructuring
```
const t = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const [first, second, ...rest] = t

console.log(first, second)  // 1, 2 is printed
console.log(rest)          // [3, 4, 5] is printed
```
6. Objects
	1. Object literals
		1. Properties listed between curly braces
		2. `const obj = { name: 'Kevin', age: 27 }`
		3. Property values can be of any type ( integers, strings, arrays, objects )
		4. Accessed using dot notation or with brackets
			1. `obj.name`
			2. `obj['name']`
		5. Can also use dot / bracket notation to add properties 
			1. `obj['occupation'] = 'SWE'` returns `{ name: 'Kevin', age: 27, occupation: 'SWE' }`
			2. `obj.occupation = 'SWE'` returns `{ name: 'Kevin', age:27, occupation: 'SWE' }`
7. Functions
	1. Can be defined as an ES6 arrow function
		1. `const newFunc = () => {}`
	2. Can be defined with a function declaration
		1. `function newFunc () { }`
	3. Can also use a function expression
		1. `const newFunc = function() {}`
	4. Function can be called to run its code
		1. `newFunc()`
8. Object Methods and 'this'
	1. Keyword `this` refers to the direct parent object itself
9. Classes
	1. Simulates how classes are created in strict object-oriented languages
	2. Can help when defining high level JS objects for an OOP approach
```
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name
    this.age = age
  }
  greet() {
    console.log('hello, my name is ' + this.name)
  }
}

const adam = new Person('Adam Ondra', 29)
adam.greet()

const janja = new Person('Janja Garnbret', 23)
janja.greet()
```
