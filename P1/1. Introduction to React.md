1. `create-react-app`
	1. CLI tool for creating and setting up basic React app
	2. `npx create-react-app appName`
2. React components
	1. Combined HTML markup, CSS, and JavaScript
	2. Combined items referred to as components 
	3. Can create custom components for use in a project, or could use open-source component libraries like Material UI and Chakra UI
3. Rendering React content
	1. `ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />)`
	2. This command renders the `App` element into an element with `id='root'` which in most projects is an `index.html` file
	3. HTML file can be edited directly, styles linked, markdown added, etc. But content that requires dynamic updates must be injected by React, AKA as a child of `App`
	4. Component files can have any kind of JavaScript contained in them, so data can be updated programmatically and then used in the component itself to render dynamic content 
	5. In the example below, an arrow function is defined that when called returns the value of the function, a React component 
```
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello world</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

4. JSX
	1. JSX appears to be HTML, but it is not. Rather it is compiled into JS to render HTML elements when loaded
	2. After compilation, it will appear as: 
	```
	const App = () => {
	  const now = new Date()
	  const a = 10
	  const b = 20
	  return React.createElement(
	    'div',
	    null,
	    React.createElement(
	      'p', null, 'Hello world, it is ', now.toString()
	    ),
	    React.createElement(
	      'p', null, a, ' plus ', b, ' is ', a + b
	    )
	  )
	}
	```
	3. Compilation is handled by a tool called `babel` 
	4. With JSX, you can add dynamic content by writing JS within curly braces
		1. `<h1>{user.name}</h1>`
		2. This will take the `name` property from the `user` object and render it in the h1 element which is rendered 
	5. All JSX tags need to be closed, so with HTML elements like `br` which in HTML is valid as `<br>` would need to be converted to `<br />`
5. Multiple components
	1. Components can be combined and nested with one another to form a tree, very similar to how HTML would be structured 
	2. Common convention is to have a root component at the 'top-level' which renders all following components, such as `App`
6. Props: Passing data to components 
	1. Props refer to parameters passed to a function component which can then be used in the component itself
	2. `const Hello = (props) => <h1>{props.name}</h1>`
	3. Able to have an arbitrary number of props 
		1. Can be 'hard-coded' values, or values returned from JavaScript functions
7. Notes
	1. React component names should be capitalized, as not doing so can create nampespace issues like:
		1. `const footer = () => {}`
		2. `<App><footer /></App>`
		3. This will cause the app to crash, as React will attempt to render the HTML element `<footer>` instead of your component 
	2. React elements will usually require at least one root element, like a `div` to render properly 
		1. Can be bypassed by returning an array of elements instead
		2. Can also be bypassed by using React 'fragments' like so 
			1. `<><h1>Title</h1><Footer /></>`
	3. React will not render objects as children, so exact values (primitives) from an object must be specified to be rendered
