1. Complex state
	1. When state is greater than one or two simple primitive values
	2. Arrays, objects, etc. 
	3. Best handled by using multiple pieces of state, or giving each entity its own stateful constant
2. Object spread operator
	1. `{ ...items }`
	2. Returns all items within an object
	3. If a property is specified and the value changed, a new object will be returned
		1. `{ ...items, age: 28 }`
3. FORBIDDEN IN REACT TO MUTATE STATE DIRECTLY
	1. Returning copies + changes of objects AKA returning a new object with needed properties updated, is the proper way to handle state changes
	2. Mutating state directly can cause a multitude of errors in running code 
	3. Arrays should also be handled as immutable objects, making copies before updating the array 
4. State updates occur asynchronously 
	1. Updates will occur 'at some point' before the component is rendered again 
5. Debugging React applications
	1. `console.log()` for variables, timings, etc. can be an extremely useful way of debugging 
	2. `debugger`
		1. Can be written anywhere in code and the browser will stop exsecuting at that point 
		2. Console should display current functions and values 
		3. Can use stepper in console to execute multiple debugger commands 
		4. Can add breakpoints directly in 'sources' tab
	3. React Developer Tools
6. Rules of Hooks
	1. Can not be called:
		1. In a loop
		2. In a conditional expression
		3. Any place that is not a function defining a component 
7. Do not define components within components 
8.
